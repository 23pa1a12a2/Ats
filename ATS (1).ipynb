            "\n",
            "1.  **Clear & Concise:** The language is professional, direct, and easy to read.\n",
            "2.  **Strong Academic Record:** Your 9.2 CGPA is impressive and prominently displayed. Relevant coursework is a good addition.\n",
            "3.  **Future Internship:** The Google AI/ML internship is a HUGE asset, even if it's upcoming. This will catch recruiters' eyes.\n",
            "4.  **Well-Described Projects:** Both projects show practical application of skills, clear technologies used, and quantifiable/impactful results (e.g., \"dynamic CRUD operations,\" \"automated responses to improve efficiency\").\n",
            "5.  **Relevant Technical Skills:** A good mix of programming languages, web technologies, databases, and fundamental concepts. Categorization is helpful.\n",
            "6.  **Action-Oriented Language:** You use strong action verbs in your experience and project descriptions.\n",
            "7.  **Certifications:** These add credibility and demonstrate continuous learning.\n",
            "8.  **Complete Contact Information:** Phone, email, LinkedIn are all there.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Areas for Improvement (Crucial & Minor):\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Critical - GitHub Link:** Your GitHub link is just `github.com`. It needs to be your full profile link, e.g., `github.com/yourusername`. This is a *must-fix* as recruiters will definitely look for it.\n",
            "2.  **Critical - Experience Dates:** \"Jan 2025 – Mar 2025\" for your EduSkills internship implies it's in the future. You *must* clarify this. Options:\n",
            "    *   `Upcoming: Jan 2025 – Mar 2025`\n",
            "    *   `Expected: Jan 2025 – Mar 2025`\n",
            "    *   `Planned: Jan 2025 – Mar 2025`\n",
            "    Failing to do so can make it seem like you're misrepresenting your experience.\n",
            "3.  **Minor - Summary Specificity:** While good, it's slightly generic. You could subtly weave in your interest in AI/ML or web development since those are your strongest points (e.g., \"...solid foundation in software development, particularly with a keen interest in AI/ML and web technologies.\").\n",
            "4.  **Minor - Experience Title Clean-up:** \"EduSkills - AICTE Internship, : Google AI/ML Intern\" has a slight redundancy with the colon. Perhaps: \"EduSkills - AICTE Internship: Google AI/ML Intern\" or \"Google AI/ML Intern (via EduSkills - AICTE Internship program)\".\n",
            "5.  **Minor - \"Python Basics\":** If you're comfortable enough to use Python in projects, you can probably just list it as \"Python.\" \"Basics\" can sometimes sound like you only know variables and loops. If your comfort level is truly basic, then keep it, but consider if you've done more.\n",
            "6.  **Technical Foundations - \"Machine Learning Fundamentals\":** While good, if you have specific ML concepts you understand (e.g., supervised/unsupervised learning, regression, classification, neural networks basics), you could mention them. Otherwise, \"Fundamentals\" is fine.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Recommendations:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Implement the critical fixes immediately** (GitHub link and experience dates).\n",
            "*   **Tailor the summary slightly** depending on the specific job you're applying for.\n",
            "*   **Continue building projects**, especially those that integrate your AI/ML and web skills.\n",
            "*   **Keep learning and adding to your certifications.**\n",

            "*   **Demonstrate Database Optimization Skills:** If you have theoretical knowledge or practical experience with database optimization techniques (e.g., designing efficient schemas, writing optimized SQL queries, indexing strategies), add these explicitly to your skills or project descriptions.\n",
            "*   **Specify Java Backend Frameworks:** While \"Full Stack Development (Java)\" is good, mentioning specific Java backend frameworks you've worked with (e.g., Spring Boot, Jakarta EE) would further strengthen your Java backend credentials.\n",
            "*   **Tailor Keywords:** Ensure the resume uses keywords from the job description like \"API development,\" \"database optimization,\" and \"backend services\" if your experience aligns, to improve ATS parsing.\n",
            "*   **Expand on Technical Experience in Internship:** While the Google AI/ML internship is impressive, for this particular role, emphasize any transferable skills or foundational computer science principles applied, even if the primary focus wasn't Java backend.\n"
